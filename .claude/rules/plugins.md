# Plugins

Plugins extend Viboplr with information sections, image providers, stream resolvers, download providers, context menu actions, sidebar views, event hooks, and settings panels.

## Architecture

Two-layer system:
1. **Rust layer** — image download worker with Rust-JS bridge, embedded artwork extraction, SQLite-backed caching, plugin file I/O, info type / image provider / stream resolver / download provider storage, scheduler, system exec (allow-listed), env var access.
2. **TypeScript layer** — plugin discovery and loading (`usePlugins.ts`), info type orchestration (`useInformationTypes.ts`), image resolution bridge (`useImageResolver.ts`), stream resolver chain and download provider chain (`App.tsx`), rendering (`InformationSections.tsx`, `PluginViewRenderer.tsx`).

## Directory Structure

Plugins live in `src-tauri/plugins/`. Each plugin is a folder with:
```
plugin-name/
├── manifest.json    # Metadata and contributions
└── index.js         # Plugin code (ES5, executed via new Function("api", code))
```

User-installed plugins (in app data directory) override built-in plugins with the same ID.

### Externally-maintained plugins

These plugins are **not bundled** in `src-tauri/plugins/`. Their canonical source is a separate repo, and they are installed from the plugin gallery (`outcast1000/viboplr-plugins`, index-only) which resolves each entry's `updateUrl` to that repo's GitHub release zip. Once installed they live in the user plugin dir and auto-update via the same `updateUrl`. To change one, edit + release in its repo; there is no bundled copy here to sync.

| Plugin id | Canonical repo | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `spotify-browse` | `outcast1000/viboplr-spotify` | Self-contained; release flow + `scripts/bump.sh` live in that repo. |
| `tidal-browse` | `outcast1000/viboplr-tidal` | Self-contained (HTTP via `api.network.fetch`); same release flow. |
| `p2p-sharing` | `outcast1000/viboplr-p2p` | **JS UI shell only.** The P2P engine lives in this host's Rust (`src-tauri/src/p2p/`, the `api.p2p.*` bridge) and is version-coupled to `outcast1000/viboplr-relay`. Releases in that repo change only the UI; protocol/networking changes are host+relay changes here. The plugin's `minAppVersion` gates its install/auto-update — bump it when you change `api.p2p.*` so older apps don't pull an incompatible shell. |
| `youtube` | `outcast1000/viboplr-youtube` | Self-contained; contributes the `youtube-fallback` stream resolver + `youtube-download` download provider. Shells out to `yt-dlp`/`ffmpeg` via `api.system.exec`. Same release flow (`scripts/bump.sh` + CI) as the others. **Not** in the gallery as a loose copy — un-bundling means fresh installs have no YouTube playback/download until it's installed from the gallery. |

### Registering a plugin in the gallery

The gallery (`outcast1000/viboplr-plugins`) is **index-only** — it hosts no plugin code, only an `index.json` that points at each plugin's own-repo release. "Registering" a plugin = adding an entry to that `index.json`. The chain is:

```
viboplr-plugins/index.json  →  entry.updateUrl  →  <repo>/releases/latest/download/update.json  →  the .zip
```

At install, `install_gallery_plugin_by_update_url` reads the entry's `updateUrl`, fetches that `update.json` (enforcing `minAppVersion`), downloads the `file` zip it names, and installs via `install_plugin_from_zip`. So the plugin's repo + a published release must exist **before** registering — the gallery entry is the last step, not the first.

**Steps:**

1. **Plugin repo with a release.** The repo has `manifest.json` + `index.js`; the release assets are `<name>.zip` (with `manifest.json` at the zip **root** — the installer does not strip a wrapper folder) and `update.json`. The `scripts/package.sh` + `.github/workflows/release.yml` pattern (see `viboplr-youtube`) produces both. The permanent endpoint is `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/releases/latest/download/update.json`.

2. **Add an entry to `index.json`** (`version: 2`, under `plugins[]`):
   ```json
   {
     "id": "youtube",
     "name": "YouTube",
     "author": "Viboplr",
     "description": "Play and download tracks from YouTube via yt-dlp",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "minAppVersion": "0.9.4",
     "updateUrl": "https://github.com/outcast1000/viboplr-youtube/releases/latest/download/update.json"
   }
   ```
   - `id` **must** match the plugin's `manifest.json` `id` exactly (it's the override/storage key).
   - `updateUrl` is the only load-bearing field for install. `name`/`description`/`version`/`minAppVersion` are display metadata for the gallery list; the *real* version/min-app gate is enforced from the live `update.json` at install time. Keep them roughly in sync with the manifest.

3. **Commit & push `index.json`.** Live for everyone on their next Extensions open — no host app release required.

**After registration, updates are automatic** — the app re-checks each `updateUrl` ~every 24h and auto-updates installed copies. Touch `index.json` again only when display metadata changes materially (rename, description, or a `minAppVersion` bump you want shown pre-install).

}
```

`debugOnly: true` hides the plugin unless the app is running in debug mode. Plugins reload automatically when the debug mode setting flips.

## Plugin Lifecycle

1. **Discovery** — `invoke("plugin_list_installed")` scans user and built-in plugin dirs. User plugins override built-in by ID.
2. **Validation** — checks `minAppVersion` via semver comparison. Incompatible plugins get status `"incompatible"`. `debugOnly` plugins are filtered out when debug mode is off.
3. **Activation** — reads `index.js` via `plugin_read_file`, executes `new Function("api", code)(api)`, calls `activate(api)`.
4. **Running** — plugin handlers respond to events, fetch requests, UI actions, stream/download resolves.
5. **Deactivation** — calls `deactivate()`, clears all handlers and unsubscribers.

When a plugin's version changes, all its cached information values are deleted, forcing re-fetch.

## Plugin API

Plugins receive an `api` object. The plugin exports `activate(api)` and optionally `deactivate()`. The canonical TypeScript definitions live in `src/types/plugin.ts` (`ViboplrPluginAPI`).

### api.log(level, message, section?)

Top-level logger. Writes to the app's frontend log stream. Prefer this over `console.log` for persistent diagnostics.

### api.library
- `getTracks(opts?)` — `{ artistId?, albumId?, tagId?, limit?, offset? }`
- `ftsTracks(query, opts?)` / `ftsArtists(query, opts?)` / `ftsAlbums(query, opts?)` / `ftsTags(query, opts?)` — FTS5 search
- `getArtists(opts?)` / `getAlbums(opts?)` / `getTags(opts?)` — paginated listings (`getAlbums` accepts `artistId`)
- `getTrackById(id)` / `getArtistById(id)` / `getAlbumById(id)` / `getTagById(id)`
- `getHistory(opts?)` / `getMostPlayed(opts?)` — `opts.days` switches to the rolling-window variant
- `recordHistoryPlaysBatch(plays)` — batch import scrobbles, returns `{ imported, skipped }`
- `applyTags(trackId, tagNames)` — tag tracks
- `onTrackAdded(handler)` / `onTrackRemoved(handler)` / `onScanComplete(handler)` — library events

### api.playback
- `getCurrentTrack()` / `isPlaying()` / `getPosition()`
- `playTrack(track)` / `playTracks(tracks, startIndex?, context?)` — `track` is a `PluginTrack`; `context` is `{ name, coverUrl?, source?, metadata? }`
- `insertTrack(track, position)` / `insertTracks(tracks, position)` — insert into the current queue
- `onTrackStarted(handler)` / `onTrackScrobbled(handler)` / `onTrackLiked(handler)` — playback events
- `onStreamResolve(providerId, handler)` — handler gets `(title, artistName, albumName, durationSecs)`, returns `{ url, label } | null`
- `onResolveStreamByUri(scheme, handler)` — handler gets `(id, quality?)` and returns a URL; used for custom URL schemes (e.g., `custom://`)

`PluginTrack`: `{ path?, title, artist_name?, album_title?, duration_secs?, track_number?, image_url? }`. `image_url` is shown in the now playing bar and queue when no library image exists.

### api.contextMenu
- `onAction(actionId, handler)` — handle clicks on registered context menu items. Handler receives a `PluginContextMenuTarget`.

### api.home
- `onFetchShelf(shelfId, handler)` — register a fetch handler for a shelf the plugin contributes (either via `contributes.homeShelves` in the manifest, or via `registerShelf` at runtime). Handler receives `(limit: number)` and returns `Promise<HomeShelfResult>`. Each handler call has a 5-second timeout — slow handlers are treated as `{ status: "error" }` for that cycle. Returns an unsubscriber.
- `registerShelf(descriptor)` — register a shelf at runtime. `descriptor` is `{ id, title, displayKind, limit?, icon? }`. Use this when the set of shelves depends on user-specific state (e.g., one shelf per Spotify section). Returns an unsubscriber. The static manifest path is for shelves whose set is known at build time; runtime registration is for everything else.
- `unregisterShelf(shelfId)` — drop a runtime-registered shelf.
- `onItemClick(shelfId, handler)` — take over body-clicks on this shelf's cards. Handler receives the clicked `HomeShelfItem`. When registered, the host calls it **instead of** the default click action (navigate-to-detail for `album-cards`/`artist-cards`, play for `playlist-cards`/`track-rows`) — use it to navigate into the plugin's own view (e.g. Spotify opens its playlist detail). Returns an unsubscriber. The play button on the card is unaffected; it always plays.
- `onResolvePlay(shelfId, handler)` — resolve play tracks lazily. For a `playlist-cards` item whose `tracks` you supplied empty, register a resolver; when the user presses the card's play button the host awaits `handler(item) => Promise<PluginTrack[]>` (behind a loading modal) and plays the returned tracks. Use for plugins that fetch tracks on demand. Returns an unsubscriber.

`HomeShelfResult`: `{ status: "ok", items: HomeShelfItem[] } | { status: "empty" } | { status: "error", message? }`. Empty/error/timeout shelves are filtered out for that refresh cycle (so they're not visual errors — they just don't render).

`HomeShelfItem` is a discriminated union by the parent shelf's `displayKind`:

| displayKind | Item shape |
|---|---|
| `album-cards` | `{ libraryId?, name, artistName?, coverUrl?, tracks? }` — `libraryId` makes the card navigate to the album detail page; otherwise `tracks` (PluginTrack[]) plays on click |
| `artist-cards` | `{ libraryId?, name, imageUrl? }` — `libraryId` navigates to artist detail; without it the card is a no-op on click |
| `playlist-cards` | `{ id, name, coverUrl?, subtitle?, tracks: PluginTrack[] }` — `subtitle` shown under the title; clicking plays the tracks with `{ name, coverUrl, source: "playlist" }` context |
| `track-rows` | `{ track: PluginTrack }` — clicking plays just that track |

`coverUrl` / `imageUrl` may be either a remote URL (http/https/data) or a local filesystem path — the renderer detects the difference. Local paths can carry a `#v=N` cache-busting suffix that the renderer preserves.

When a plugin is deactivated or reloaded, `usePlugins` automatically drops all of its registered home-shelf handlers and runtime descriptors.

### api.nowPlayingInfo

Contributes items to the cycling **Now Playing info** section (the line that shows under the title in the **mini player** — the full now-playing bar shows a static Artist · Album line instead; see `ui.md` "Now Playing Bar"). The host cycles through the *enabled* items; the user picks which via the mini player's native context menu. Mirrors the `api.home` register/onFetch pattern.

- `registerItem({ id, label, priority? })` — add an item at runtime. `label` is the checkbox text in the context menu; `priority` orders it among plugin items (lower first; built-ins always precede plugin items). Returns an unsubscriber.
- `unregisterItem(id)` — drop a registered item.
- `onFetch(id, handler)` — `handler(track: PluginTrack) => Promise<NowPlayingInfoResult>` resolves the item's text for the current track. Has a 5-second host-side timeout; slow handlers count as `error` for that track. Returns an unsubscriber.

`NowPlayingInfoResult`: `{ status: "ok", text } | { status: "empty" } | { status: "error", message? }`. `empty`/`error`/timeout simply hide the item for that track (no error indicator). Built-in items contributed by the core app are **Artist · Album**, **Artist**, **Album**, **Plays · Rank** (play count + chart rank from history, in one item), **Source** (Local / Subsonic / Web / scheme), **Quality** (format · sample rate · bit depth, or bitrate — via `get_audio_properties_by_path` for local files), **Duration**, **Tags** (`#`-prefixed track tags, resolved via `find_track_by_metadata` → `get_tags_for_track`), **Synced Lyrics** (the current LRC line in quotes, tracking playback position), and **Plain Lyrics** (one line of unsynced lyrics in quotes, stable per track); the Last.fm plugin contributes **Scrobbles**. The two lyrics items reuse the cached lyrics info-type (via `useLyrics`) and only fetch when enabled; each appears only when that kind of lyrics exists for the track (synced vs. plain), otherwise it's hidden for that track. Each item declares its own `defaultEnabled`; only **Artist · Album** and **Scrobbles** are on by default — everything else (including **Tags** and the lyrics items) is opt-in. When a plugin is deactivated/reloaded, `usePlugins` drops its items + handlers automatically.

### api.ui
- `setViewData(viewId, data, opts?)` — render plugin views (see `PluginViewData` types). `opts.scrollKey?: string` enables per-view scroll memory: the host saves/restores the view's scroll position keyed by `scrollKey`. Change it on navigation (new sub-view → opens at top; returning to a prior key → scroll restored); keep it stable across in-place updates so the view doesn't jump.
- `showNotification(message)` / `navigateToView(viewId)` / `requestAction(action, payload)`
- `onAction(actionId, handler)` — handle UI action events emitted from plugin views
- `setBadge(viewId, badge)` — set a sidebar badge: `null | { type: "dot", variant } | { type: "count", value, variant }`

### api.storage
- `get<T>(key)` / `set(key, value)` / `delete(key)` — SQLite-backed key-value storage per plugin
- `cacheFile(subdir, filename, url)` / `getCachePath(subdir, filename)` / `listCacheDirs()` / `deleteCacheDir(subdir)` — flat file cache (legacy)
- `files` — nested plugin file storage (see below)

### api.storage.files

Nested file I/O rooted inside the plugin's data directory. `path` is a string array (path segments joined safely by the backend).
- `writeJson(path, data)` / `readJson<T>(path)`
- `writeText(path, content)` / `readText(path)`
- `download(path, url)` — fetch URL through Rust and write to disk
- `getPath(path)` / `exists(path)`
- `list(path)` — returns `[{ name, isDir }]`
- `remove(path)` / `copy(src, dst)` / `move(src, dst)`

### api.network
- `fetch(url, init?)` — HTTP requests proxied through Rust (bypasses CORS). Returns `{ status, text(), json() }`.
- `openUrl(url)` — open in system browser
- `onDeepLink(handler)` — subscribe to deep links delivered to the app
- `openBrowseWindow(url, opts?)` — opens an embedded browse window. Returns `BrowseWindowHandle` with `eval`, `close`, `show`, `hide`, `onMessage`, `onNavigation`.

### api.collections
- `getLocalCollections()` — returns local-kind collections as `[{ id, name, path }]`

### api.playlists
- `save(data)` / `list()` / `delete(id)` / `getTracks(id)` — saved playlists (source-aware, image-aware)

### api.informationTypes
- `onFetch(infoTypeId, handler)` — handler receives an `InfoEntity`, returns `{ status: "ok", value } | { status: "not_found" } | { status: "error", message? }`.

There is **no** `api.informationTypes.invoke` escape hatch — plugins cannot call arbitrary Tauri commands.

### api.imageProviders
- `onFetch(entity, handler)` — entity is `"artist"` or `"album"`. Handler receives `(name, artistName?)` and returns `{ status: "ok", url, headers? } | { status: "ok", data } | { status: "not_found" } | { status: "error", message? }`.

### api.downloads
- `enqueue(request)` — queue a download through the unified downloader. `request: { title, artistName?, albumTitle?, uri?, durationSecs?, destCollectionId?, destCollectionPath?, format?, provider? }`. Returns the download ID.
- `onResolveByUri(providerId, handler)` — handler receives `(uri, format)` and returns a `DownloadResolveResult | null`
- `onResolveByMetadata(providerId, handler)` — handler receives `(title, artistName, albumName, durationSecs, format)`
- `onInteractiveSearch(providerId, handler)` — handler receives `(query, limit)` and returns `InteractiveSearchResult[]` for the `DownloadModal` manual-search flow
- `onInteractiveResolve(providerId, handler)` — handler receives `(matchId, format)` and returns a `DownloadResolveResult`

`DownloadResolveResult`: `{ url, headers?, metadata?: { title, artist, album, trackNumber, year, genre, coverUrl } }`.

### api.scheduler
- `register(taskId, intervalMs)` / `unregister(taskId)` / `complete(taskId)` — periodic task registration. Backend emits `plugin-scheduler-due` events at the configured interval.
- `onDue(taskId, handler)` — invoked when the task is due

### api.system
- `exec(program, args?, opts?)` — run a subprocess, returns `{ exitCode, stdout, stderr }`. **Allow-list only:** currently `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg`. `opts.cwd` defaults to the app data directory.

### api.env
- `get(key)` — read an environment variable

## Information Sections

Tabbed metadata panels shown on entity detail pages (artists, albums, tracks, tags).

### Provider Chain

Multiple plugins can provide the same information type ID (e.g., both `lastfm` and `genius` provide `artist_bio`). The app hardcodes default priority ordering (in `usePlugins.ts`). Users can reorder providers in Settings > Providers. Lower `priority` number = tried first. First success wins.

### Entity Keys

Cached values use **name-based keys** (not DB IDs), enabling cross-library metadata sharing:
- Artist: `artist:{name}`
- Album: `album:{artistName}:{name}`
- Track: `track:{artistName}:{name}`
- Tag: `tag:{name}`

### Cache Decision Logic (`useInformationTypes.ts`)

| Cached Status | TTL State | Action |
|---|---|---|
| No cache | — | fetch (show loading) |
| `"ok"` | fresh | render cached |
| `"ok"` | stale | render cached + refetch in background |
| `"not_found"` / `"error"` | fresh (< 1 hour) | hidden |
| `"not_found"` / `"error"` | stale (>= 1 hour) | retry fetch |

Success TTL is per-type (e.g., 90 days for bios, 7 days for popularity). Error TTL is fixed 1 hour. Concurrent fetches for the same `typeId:entityKey` are deduplicated via `inFlightRef` Set.

### Placement

| Placement | Display Kinds |
|---|---|
| **Title (inline in header)** | `title_line` — rendered by `TitleLineInfo.tsx`, never appears as a tab |
| **Right sidebar** | `ranked_list`, `tag_list`, `image_gallery` |
| **Below (main tabs)** | All others: `rich_text`, `html`, `entity_list`, `entity_cards`, `stat_grid`, `lyrics`, `annotated_text`, `annotations`, `key_value` |

### Display Kind Data Schemas

| displayKind | Data Shape |
|---|---|
| `rich_text` | `{summary, full?}` |
| `html` | `{content}` |
| `entity_list` | `{items: [{name, subtitle?, match?, image?, libraryId?, libraryKind?}]}` |
| `entity_cards` | `{items: [{name, subtitle?, match?, image?, libraryId?, libraryKind?}]}` |
| `stat_grid` | `{items: [{label, value, unit?}]}` |
| `lyrics` | `{text, kind: "plain"|"synced", lines?: [{time, text}]}` |
| `tag_list` | `{tags: [{name, url?}], suggestable?}` |
| `ranked_list` | `{items: [{name, subtitle?, value, maxValue?, libraryId?, libraryKind?}]}` |
| `annotated_text` | `{overview?, sections: [{heading?, text}]}` |
| `annotations` | `{overview?, annotations: [{fragment, explanation}]}` |
| `key_value` | `{items: [{key, value}]}` |
| `image_gallery` | `{images: [{url, caption?, source?}]}` |
| `title_line` | `{items: [{label, value}]}` |

### Built-in Actions

Renderers emit actions via `onAction(actionId, payload)`. Built-in actions handled by `InformationSections.tsx`:

| Action | Payload | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `save-lyrics` | `{text, kind}` | Upserts lyrics to cache |
| `play-track` | `{id}` | Plays library track by ID |
| `play-or-youtube` | `{name, artist?}` | Tries library, falls back to YouTube |
| `youtube-search` | `{name, artist?}` | Opens YouTube search |

## Image Provider Chain (Rust-JS Bridge)

Image fetching uses a bridge between the Rust download worker and JS plugin handlers.

### Flow

1. **Album only:** Rust tries `EmbeddedArtworkProvider` first (extracts from audio file via `lofty`). If found, bridge is skipped.
2. Rust worker creates a one-shot `mpsc` channel, registers it in `ImageResolveRegistry`, emits `image-resolve-request` event to frontend.
3. `useImageResolver.ts` receives event, queries `get_image_providers` for active providers in priority order.
4. Calls each plugin's `imageFetchHandlers` sequentially. First `{status: "ok"}` wins.
5. Sends result back via `image_resolve_response` command (URL with optional headers, or base64 data).
6. Rust worker downloads from URL (or decodes base64), saves to disk, emits `artist-image-ready` / `album-image-ready`.
7. On failure or 30s timeout: records in `image_fetch_failures` table.

### Default Priority Order (user-configurable via Settings > Providers)

Priority order is user-configurable via Settings > Providers. Default priority is hardcoded internally in `usePlugins.ts` (lower number = higher priority). Unknown plugins are added last (priority 999). For albums, the Rust-native `EmbeddedArtworkProvider` always runs first before any plugin providers.

## Stream Resolver Chain

Stream resolvers provide playback URLs when a track's native source isn't available (e.g., library track missing on disk, external track without a direct URL).

### Flow (`App.tsx` `streamResolversRef`)

For each track to play:
1. If a local copy exists for the track's metadata, use it.
2. If the track has a native URL (`file://`, `subsonic://`, or `http(s)://`), try the native resolver. Plugin-registered schemes are resolved via `onResolveStreamByUri`.
3. Walk the user-ordered list of plugin stream resolvers. Each is called with `(title, artistName, albumName, durationSecs)` and has 60 seconds to return `{ url, label } | null` (resolvers like YouTube shell out to `yt-dlp`, which can be slow).
4. First success wins. Failures fall through to the next resolver. `addLog` surfaces fallback info to the user.

### Custom URL Schemes

`api.playback.onResolveStreamByUri(scheme, handler)` registers a resolver for a custom URL scheme (e.g., `custom://`). The handler returns a playable URL for a given `(id, quality?)`.

### Configuration

Users can drag-and-drop reorder and toggle stream resolvers on/off in Settings > Providers. Order and enabled state are stored under `streamResolverOrder` in the app store.

## Download Provider Chain

Download providers implement URL resolution for the unified `DownloadModal`.

- **By URI:** a plugin handles a specific scheme (e.g., `custom://`, `external://`) via `onResolveByUri`. Used when the app already has a canonical URI.
- **By metadata:** a plugin accepts arbitrary `(title, artistName, albumName, durationSecs, format)` via `onResolveByMetadata`. Used for automatic fallbacks (e.g., YouTube search-and-download).
- **Interactive:** a plugin contributes `onInteractiveSearch` + `onInteractiveResolve`, surfaced as manual search inside `DownloadModal` with per-track picking.

Providers are prioritized by internal hardcoded defaults (in `usePlugins.ts`); unknown plugins are added last. The built-in Subsonic provider handles `subsonic://` URIs natively.

## Home Shelves

Plugins contribute horizontal shelves to the Home page via `api.home`. Two paths:

- **Static (manifest):** `contributes.homeShelves[]` declares a fixed set known at build time. Each entry must still register a fetch handler via `api.home.onFetchShelf(shelfId, handler)`.
- **Runtime:** `api.home.registerShelf(descriptor)` adds a shelf programmatically. Use this when the set depends on user-specific state — e.g., the Spotify plugin contributes one shelf per active section, and re-syncs them whenever the user adds or removes a section.

The merged manifest + runtime list is exposed by `usePlugins` as `homeShelves` and consumed by `useHome` (see `ui.md` "Home View"). Built-in shelves are listed first; plugin shelves follow.

**Refresh contract:** Home calls every shelf's handler on view-mount only when the persisted snapshot is older than 24 hours (or absent). The user can also trigger a refresh manually via the toolbar button at any time. Each handler has a 5-second timeout — keep them fast or kick off background work elsewhere and serve from cached state. Returning `{ status: "empty" }` hides the shelf for that cycle (no error indicator). Returning `{ status: "error", message }` logs to `console.error` and hides the shelf.

**Image rules:** local paths (e.g. plugin-cached covers under `api.storage.files`) are run through `convertFileSrc` automatically. Append `#v=<timestamp>` to bust the WebView cache when content changes. Remote URLs (http/https/data) are passed through unchanged.

**Click semantics:** by default, for `playlist-cards`, `playTracks` is invoked with `{ name, coverUrl, source: "playlist" }` context, which gives the queue panel a banner — don't replicate that wiring inside the plugin, Home does it for you. To override the default (e.g. navigate into the plugin's own view instead of playing), register `api.home.onItemClick(shelfId, handler)`; when present it wins over the default body-click action. The play button on the card still plays regardless.

**Live example:** `src-tauri/plugins/spotify-browse/index.js` — the `syncHomeShelves` function diffs desired vs. registered shelves on every `render()`, registering one playlist-card shelf per Spotify section and serving items from in-memory `state.playlists` / `state.playlistTracks`. It also registers `onItemClick` per shelf so clicking a card navigates into the Spotify view and opens that playlist's detail page.

## Plugin View Rendering

Plugins with sidebar items render UI via `PluginViewData` (separate from info type renderers). Set data via `api.ui.setViewData(viewId, data)`.

| Type | Purpose |
|---|---|

### Toggle Control Note

Toggle controls use `checked: boolean`, not `value`. `{ type: "toggle", label, action, checked }`.
